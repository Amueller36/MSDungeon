This is a Bot written in Kotlin for the game https://the-microservice-dungeon.gitlab.io/docs/
It automatically buys robots and has smart strategies to defeat the enemy players.
This repository includes a Dockerfile to containerize the bot and run it via docker or you could use the deployment file to deploy the player to a kubernetes environment.
